The objective of this project is to provide the RSK community with a safe and simple (from a developer's point of view) solution to create accounts that require multiple signatures to transact their funds.

## Abstract

The solution consists of four main modules:

* A suite of smart contracts that allow creating multi-sig accounts
* A Node.js and Web SDK for creating and operating multi-sig
* Proper documentation that will help developers to integrate the solution to different projects
* A sample application exposing a correct user experience for operating multi-sig.
